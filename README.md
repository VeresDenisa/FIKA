# FIKA - Smart Facade Architecture

FIKA is a project based on improving the living standards and the cost of mentenance of any old building. 

Basic idea:
  1. Building a smart facade made of solar panels and wind boards.
  2. The solar panels follow the sun movement during the day and generate electricity, which is used to power the solar tracking system and auxiliar building systems.
  3. The smart facade is supposed to be implemented after the construction of the actual building, like a modular furniture piece, which can be assambled and disassembled any time.
  4. The solar panels and the wind boards are supposed to provide shade and to be a heat shield during most scorching summers.
